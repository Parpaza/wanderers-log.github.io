Wanderer's Log is my personal site where I blog about my interests with a particular focus on TTRPGs, Worldbuilding, and Science Fiction. It's been created with a lot of love and passion using Jekyll and Github-Pages.

Feel free to hang around and read my thoughts on the various aspects of my interests and peruse my clumsy attempts at worldbuilding.

Always remember to keep your sights on the stars and your feet firmly planted to the ground. *Ad astra per aspera.*
