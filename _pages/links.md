This page serves as a hub of links that I have personally found useful or interesting, and in turn, you may find useful for yourself as well.

# Blogs
- [Another GURPS Blog](https://anothergurpsblog.blogspot.com)
  - A blog covering the excellent GURPS pen-and-paper RPG by Steve Jackson Games. I find the author's thoughts on various GURP related matters to be interesting and useful.
- [Gaming Ballistic](https://gamingballistic.com/)
  - A GURPS blog that I find incredibly useful for its exploration and discussion of the system. Also sells some cool books for DFRPG.
- [Generic Universal Eggplant](https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com)
  - Combined with the author's YouTube channel ([Dungeons and GURPS](https://www.youtube.com/@dungeonsandgurps)) I find this blog to be a splendid reference for converting aspects of D&D into GURPS.

# Reddit

# Websites
- [Word Mill Games](https://www.wordmillgames.com)
